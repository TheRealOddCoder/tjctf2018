Its a stream cipher. I started working on rc4 encryption algorithm and did not get any results for a long time.

The description said "took an L". Then, after a few searches I came to know that there is an algorithm called LC4.
That's why it's called "took an L".

I found a github repo that implemented lc4 algorithm,
https://github.com/dstein64/LC4/blob/master/documentation.md

Then the flag is easily decrypted.
